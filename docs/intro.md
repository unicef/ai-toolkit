# Introduction

##What is Personalized Learning and How Can it Improve Learning Outcomes?

This open source toolkit can help country offices, governments and partners be able to plug and play personalised learning functionality into their own learning management system solutions. Included are training data sets (but protected to keep privacy and confidentiality), open algorithms, and a ‘how do I now retrain this open algorithm and integrate it into my LMS’ guide.

Personalized learning can help reduce the global learning gap through intentional planning with non-urban and learner groups at the lower end of the achievement distribution. In the last decade, advancements in data science and machine learning have led to an explosion in tech-enabled, data-driven solutions to personalize learning. Research has shown that pedagogical interventions that tailor teaching to student learning levels are effective at improving student test scores in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Evidence is emerging that tech-enabled PL can reduce the learning gap for lower attaining students. The adaptive nature of personalized learning to teach at the right level. Most PL products directly aid teachers with the teaching-learning process by facilitating monitoring of learning and in some cases, instruction. Fewer products also help indirectly by easing administrative tasks or by facilitating communication. Contrary to common misconception of PL products replacing teachers, most products feature an active role for the teacher in aiding students’ learning.


## Technical Glossary

AI-enabled adaptation is increasingly becoming common in LMICs. These tools monitor, assess students learning, and adapt the learning pathway based on AI-enabled predictive analytics. It also includes AI-driven data processing methods to provide feedback and point to resources.

To create an optimal learning path for learners, AI-powered PL requires large volumes of comprehensive, balanced, representative and multidimensional data about user’s engagement with the system which include, but not limited to, their behavior and interaction with the content and activities. To fully realize the promise of personalized learning, systems must have access to a wide range of other applications within the institutional enterprise data repositories as well as third-party web services apps. However, the vast majority of scanned PL systems seem to rely largely on data obtained from particular functions activated within their software. Lack of large, comprehensive and representative training data not only inhibits the accuracy of the predictions, but it also introduces bias.

Approaches to Adaptation

 Limited algorithm-enabled adaptation includes solutions that can be further classified into two categories: (a) products that offer adaptation through static "If-Then" branching sequences where learners go through either one predetermined learning path; or (b) static learning paths set at intervals throughout the learning journey, allowing learners to advance or regress individually. 
 
 The main data inputs used by products to adapt and personalize learning pathways are cognitive variables that include:
performance on a pre-test, ie Chimple, ongoing performance like the number of correct/incorrect answers, or 
formative assessments.

Some of the products use learner-declared goals where learners can state what level of competency they would like to achieve to determine the endpoint of the learning path. 

Others use affective variables like learner engagement or motivation.
