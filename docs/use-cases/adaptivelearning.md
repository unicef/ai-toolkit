# Adaptive Learning

Adaptive Learning AI tools improve safety, efficiency and automation of learning-related processes such as automating evaluations, assessments, scoring.

Below are several offerings in the toolkit that provide Adaptive Learning solutions.

## Chimple

The Chimple reading and writing curriculum for grades K-2 starts from alphabet and letter recognition, going on to phonics, word recognition, print concepts and finally fluency and comprehension. When the child enters the app for the first time, a placement test is given. Based on the results of the placement test, the AI engine figures out the current learning level of the child. Subsequently, every time the child logs in, a customized welcome screen with recommended lessons for the child is shown. If the child wants to explore independently, every first lesson of each chapter is open. As the child finishes each lesson, the next lesson opens up. Every few lessons, a challenge is presented to the child to ascertain whether the previous lessons have been mastered. If so, the next lesson is opened. If not, the recommendation engine will make sure the child repeats the lessons till they get mastery over the material.
